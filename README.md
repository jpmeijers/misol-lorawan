# LoRa Weather Station

__THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS__

This repo contains a design for a replacement PCB for a MISOL weather station. The replacement PCB fits in the same space and enclosure as the original transmitter board. It sends the sensor data via a LoRa radio. The new PCB supports LoRaWAN and can send the data to a network like The Things Network.

The PCB design is done using KiCad.
